\begin{document}
\maketitle

This page will contain all the assignments you submit for the class.

\hypertarget{instructions-for-all-assignments}{%
\subsubsection{Instructions for all
assignments}\label{instructions-for-all-assignments}}

I want you to submit your assignment as a PDF, so I can keep a record of
what the code looked like that day. I also want you to include your
answers on your personal GitHub website. This will be good practice for
editing your website and it will help you produce something you can keep
after the class is over.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Download the Assignment1.Rmd file from Canvas. You can use this as a
  template for writing your answers. It's the same as what you can see
  on my website in the Assignments tab. Once we're done with this I'll
  edit the text on the website to include the solutions.
\item
  On RStudio, open a new R script in RStudio (File \textgreater{} New
  File \textgreater{} R Script). This is where you can test out your R
  code. You'll write your R commands and draw plots here.
\item
  Once you have finalized your code, copy and paste your results into
  this template (Assignment 1.Rmd). For example, if you produced a plot
  as the solution to one of the problems, you can copy and paste the R
  code in R markdown by using the
  \texttt{\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}\{r\}\ \textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}}
  command. Answer the questions in full sentences and Save.
\item
  Produce a PDF file with your answers. To do this, knit to PDF (use
  Knit button at the top of RStudio), locate the PDF file in your docs
  folder (it's in the same folder as the Rproj), and submit that on on
  Canvas in Assignment 1.
\item
  Build Website, go to GitHub desktop, commit and push. Now your
  solutions should be on your website as well.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Collaborators: Lorem Ipsum. }

This assignment is due on Canvas on Monday 9/20 before class, at 10:15
am. Include the name of anyone with whom you collaborated at the top of
the assignment.

\hypertarget{problem-1-.}{%
\subsubsection{Problem 1 .}\label{problem-1-.}}

Install the datasets package on the console below using
\texttt{install.packages("datasets")}. Now load the library. Answer:
I've loaded the library.

Load the USArrests dataset and rename it \texttt{dat}. Note that this
dataset comes with R, in the package datasets, so there's no need to
load data from your computer. Why is it useful to rename the dataset?
dat \textless- USArrests \#renaming the data Answer: It is useful to
rename a dataset for our data analysis because we will be replicating
analyses. This way we can separate the original file from our revised
file easily by name.

\hypertarget{problem-2}{%
\subsubsection{Problem 2}\label{problem-2}}

Use this command to make the state names into a new variable called
State.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{dat}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{state }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{tolower}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{rownames}\NormalTok{(USArrests))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

dat\$state \textless- tolower(rownames(USArrests)) This dataset has the
state names as row names, so we just want to make them into a new
variable. We also make them all lower case, because that will help us
draw a map later - the map function requires the states to be lower
case.

List the variables contained in the dataset \texttt{USArrests}. Answer:
The variables contained are Murder, Assault, UrbanPop, Rape.

\hypertarget{problem-3}{%
\subsubsection{Problem 3}\label{problem-3}}

What type of variable (from the DVB chapter) is \texttt{Murder}?

Answer: Murder is a quantitative variable.

What R Type of variable is it?

Answer: It is a numeric R Type variable.

\hypertarget{problem-4}{%
\subsubsection{Problem 4}\label{problem-4}}

What information is contained in this dataset, in general? What do the
numbers mean?

Answer: This dataset includes information about the urban population
size and rates of various crimes (murder, rape, and assault) among the
50 U.S. states. The numbers represent the rate at which the
aforementioned crimes occur in each state.

\hypertarget{problem-5}{%
\subsubsection{Problem 5}\label{problem-5}}

Draw a histogram of \texttt{Murder} with proper labels and title.
hist(dat\$Murder, main=``Histogram of Murder'', xlab=``Murder Rate'',
ylab=``Number of States'')

\hypertarget{problem-6}{%
\subsubsection{Problem 6}\label{problem-6}}

Please summarize \texttt{Murder} quantitatively. What are its mean and
median? What is the difference between mean and median? What is a
quartile, and why do you think R gives you the 1st Qu. and 3rd Qu.?

Answer: The mean for murder is 7.788 and the median for murder is 7.250.
Although the mean and median are both measures of central tendency, the
mean is the ``balance point'' for which symmetry holds. Mathematically,
the mean is the sum of all the data values divdided by the total number
of data values. In contrast, the median is the middle value found from
putting all the data values from least to greatest. Quartiles are the
three values which divide the data into equal fourths. R gives us the
first and third quartiles so that we get a better sense of the
distribution of a data set when it may not be symmetrical. In this case
we know, 1/4 of the values fall below 4.075, and 3/4 of the values fall
below 11.250.

\hypertarget{problem-7}{%
\subsubsection{Problem 7}\label{problem-7}}

Repeat the same steps you followed for \texttt{Murder}, for the
variables \texttt{Assault} and \texttt{Rape}. Now plot all three
histograms together. You can do this by using the command
\texttt{par(mfrow=c(3,1))} and then plotting each of the three.

hist(dat\$Assault, main=``Histogram of Assault'', xlab=``Assault Rate'',
ylab=``Number of States'') The mean for assault is 170.8 and the median
for assault is 159.0.

hist(dat\$Rape, main=``Histogram of Rape'', xlab=``Rape Rate'',
ylab=``Number of States'') The mean for rape is 21.23 and the median for
rape is 20.10.

par(mfrow=c(3,1))
hist(dat\(Murder, main="Histogram of Murder", xlab="Murder Rate", ylab="Number of States") hist(dat\)Assault,
main=``Histogram of Assault'', xlab=``Assault Rate'', ylab=``Number of
States'') hist(dat\$Rape, main=``Histogram of Rape'', xlab=``Rape
Rate'', ylab=``Number of States'')

What does the command par do, in your own words (you can look this up by
asking R \texttt{?par})?

Answer: The command par sets the plotting parameters by letting RStudio
know I want it to make a graph with 3 rows and 1 column (with the use of
mfrow).

What can you learn from plotting the histograms together?

Answer: From plotting the histograms together, I can learn what kind of
crime is found in the greatest number of states the most. In this case,
I can learn that high assault rates are most common across the board
since it has the highest rate found in the highest number of states.

\hypertarget{problem-8}{%
\subsubsection{Problem 8}\label{problem-8}}

In the console below (not in text), type
\texttt{install.packages("maps")} and press Enter, and then type
\texttt{install.packages("ggplot2")} and press Enter. This will install
the packages so you can load the libraries.

Run this code:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}maps\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{) }
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{\textquotesingle{}ggplot2\textquotesingle{}}\NormalTok{) }

\FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(dat, }\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{map\_id=}\NormalTok{state, }\AttributeTok{fill=}\NormalTok{Murder)) }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{geom\_map}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{map=}\FunctionTok{map\_data}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"state"}\NormalTok{)) }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{expand\_limits}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x=}\FunctionTok{map\_data}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"state"}\NormalTok{)}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{long, }\AttributeTok{y=}\FunctionTok{map\_data}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"state"}\NormalTok{)}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{lat)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

What does this code do? Explain what each line is doing.

Answer: This code creates a map of crime rates among the 50 U.S. states,
specfically murder. The first line indicates we want to create a ggplot
based on USArrests; the aesthetic function indicates which variables we
want to be plotted (like murder) and how to present them. The second
line indicates that the graphical representation will be a map using the
data on states. The third line indicates what data should be plotted on
the x and y positions of the graphical depiction respectively.
